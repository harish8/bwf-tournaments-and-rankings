## About this project

This project aims to gather as much data as possible from the BWF Badminton tournament software to conduct meaningful exploratory data analysis. By creating visual charts, bars, and diagrams, we hope to provide insights into tournaments and player statistics over the years. Ultimately, my goal is to build predictive training models to better understand the popularity of professional badminton worldwide.

## Analysis and Visualization

Through the creation of visual charts, bars, and diagrams, I aim to provide a deeper understanding of tournaments and player statistics over the years. This visual representation will help to reveal patterns and trends in the data, offering insights that may not be immediately apparent from the raw data alone.

## Predictive Training Models

The ultimate goal of this project is to build predictive training models. By leveraging the data and insights gathered, I aim to predict the popularity of professional badminton worldwide. These models will enable us to anticipate future trends and inform strategic decisions in the professional badminton world.
